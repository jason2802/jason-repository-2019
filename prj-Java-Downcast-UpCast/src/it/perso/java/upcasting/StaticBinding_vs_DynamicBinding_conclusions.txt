Static Binding vs Dynamic Binding ( the two type of UPCASTING ) 

Lets discuss the difference between static and dynamic binding in Java.

Static binding happens at compile-time while dynamic binding happens at runtime.
Binding of private, static and final methods always happen at compile time since these methods cannot be overridden. 
When the method overriding is actually happening and 
the reference of parent type is assigned to the object of child class type then such binding is resolved during runtime.
The binding of overloaded methods is static and the binding of overridden methods is dynamic.
